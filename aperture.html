  <p class="maintext">Aperture is the depth of field control, also known as focus. It controls how much of an image is
    sharp, which helps
    you define a subject, and create a proper composition. Aperture exists in all cameras, from your phone, to your
    dashcam, to your laptops webcam. Understanding aperture and how it benefits you as a photographer is essential!
    Aperture is denoted as "f/" and it is called an f-stop. Some cameras have minimum values, in which set a limit for
    how little a lens can focus on. It is uniquely different than the other camera settings as it controls everything in
    a way. A very high aperture, such as f/1.4 creates a small depth of field with a minimal amount in focus. It is the
    brightest setting and is great in portrait settings. f/5.6 is a medium range aperture and works fine for landscapes,
    it lessens the brightness a bit. f/22 is a very small aperture, it is dark, and ensures everything is in focus!
    There isn't a lot that need be said for camera settings, as most of it you learn through trial and error. But
    Shutter, ISO, and Aperture are the main three!</p>
