        <td>Sony is a great brand for hybrids. They offer good video cameras that still offer great photo support, and
          vice versa. Along with this, they offer some of the best optical quality you can get!</td>
        <td>Canon is the most popular and one of the best photography options. They offer a range of cameras for all
          budgets, loads of super zoom lenses, and some great optical quality!</td>
        <td>Nikon was my starting place, they're great for their quick performance, cheaper lenses and great photo
          quality. They excel for wildlife photographers!</td>
        <td>Olympus is a lesser used, but still very capable brand. Their cameras offer great stabilisation, autofocus,
          and are great against the weather, making them great for adventurers! </td>
        <td>Leica jumps up to the most expensive end. Their cameras are sought after and great for street photographers.
          Their cameras are expensive due to the quality of their buid, and they produce less due to the smaller nature
          of their company.</td>

        <td>If you own a hasselblad, it's the equivalent to owning a porsche amongst civics.
          Hasselblad cameras are handmade, their built in filter allows for very natural, true colour, and amazing
          quality!</td>
        <td>Panasonic cameras (known as Lumix), and they offer loads of point and shoot options, along with SLR options.
          They have great sensors, and work well for vloggers and photographers.</td>
        <td>Fujifilm is well known for their polaroid cameras, offering point and shoot photo printers that many love.
          Their cameras are great for hobbyists, and they offer loads of vintage, or unique fun features. A professional
          photographer may prefer other options over Fujifilm.</td>
        <td>Pentax, an also lesser used brand, is great for budget options, providing good quality and a lower price.
          They have great lenses for bokeh, and they offer high quality for a lower price, but they do sacrifice in some
          other places. </td>
        <td>Last but not least, Kodak, a brand that has been creating cameras for ages, focusing on film cameras and
          development, they paved the way for film cameras in the 70s and 80s. </td>
